# AutoClick
There will be a 10 second wait time before autoclicking starts. Will autoclick every 0.1 seconds until the `Escape` key is pressed.

### To install:
Download the `.py` file.

Open the terminal in the folder the autoclick file is located in.

You will need the `pyautogui` and `pynput` library. If you don't have them, run the following commands in the terminal: `pip install pyautogui` and `pip install pynput`.

Run `python AutoClick.py`.

Use the `Escape` key to stop the autoclicker.
